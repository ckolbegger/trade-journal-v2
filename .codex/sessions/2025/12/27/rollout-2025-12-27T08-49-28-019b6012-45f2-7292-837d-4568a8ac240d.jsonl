Run `openspec validate <id> --strict` and resolve any issues before sharing the proposal.\n\n### Stage 2: Implementing Changes\nTrack these steps as TODOs and complete them one by one.\n1. **Read proposal.md** - Understand what's being built\n2. **Read design.md** (if exists) - Review technical decisions\n3. **Read tasks.md** - Get implementation checklist\n4. **Implement tasks sequentially** - Complete in order\n5. **Confirm completion** - Ensure every item in `tasks.md` is finished before updating statuses\n6. **Update checklist** - After all work is done, set every task to `- [x]` so the list reflects reality\n7. **Approval gate** - Do not start implementation until the proposal is reviewed and approved\n\n### Stage 3: Archiving Changes\nAfter deployment, create separate PR to:\n- Move `changes/[name]/` → `changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-[name]/`\n- Update `specs/` if capabilities changed\n- Use `openspec archive <change-id> --skip-specs --yes` for tooling-only changes (always pass the change ID explicitly)\n- Run `openspec validate --strict` to confirm the archived change passes checks\n\n## Before Any Task\n\n**Context Checklist:**\n- [ ] Read relevant specs in `specs/[capability]/spec.md`\n- [ ] Check pending changes in `changes/` for conflicts\n- [ ] Read `openspec/project.md` for conventions\n- [ ] Run `openspec list` to see active changes\n- [ ] Run `openspec list --specs` to see existing capabilities\n\n**Before Creating Specs:**\n- Always check if capability already exists\n- Prefer modifying existing specs over creating duplicates\n- Use `openspec show [spec]` to review current state\n- If request is ambiguous, ask 1–2 clarifying questions before scaffolding\n\n### Search Guidance\n- Enumerate specs: `openspec spec list --long` (or `--json` for scripts)\n- Enumerate changes: `openspec list` (or `openspec change list --json` - deprecated but available)\n- Show details:\n  - Spec: `openspec show <spec-id> --type spec` (use `--json` for filters)\n  - Change: `openspec show <change-id> --json --deltas-only`\n- Full-text search (use ripgrep): `rg -n \"Requirement:|Scenario:\" openspec/specs`\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### CLI Commands\n\n```bash\n# Essential commands\nopenspec list                  # List active changes\nopenspec list --specs          # List specifications\nopenspec show [item]           # Display change or spec\nopenspec validate [item]       # Validate changes or specs\nopenspec archive <change-id> [--yes|-y]   # Archive after deployment (add --yes for non-interactive runs)\n\n# Project management\nopenspec init [path]           # Initialize OpenSpec\nopenspec update [path]         # Update instruction files\n\n# Interactive mode\nopenspec show                  # Prompts for selection\nopenspec validate              # Bulk validation mode\n\n# Debugging\nopenspec show [change] --json --deltas-only\nopenspec validate [change] --strict\n```\n\n### Command Flags\n\n- `--json` - Machine-readable output\n- `--type change|spec` - Disambiguate items\n- `--strict` - Comprehensive validation\n- `--no-interactive` - Disable prompts\n- `--skip-specs` - Archive without spec updates\n- `--yes`/`-y` - Skip confirmation prompts (non-interactive archive)\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n```\nopenspec/\n├── project.md              # Project conventions\n├── specs/                  # Current truth - what IS built\n│   └── [capability]/       # Single focused capability\n│       ├── spec.md         # Requirements and scenarios\n│       └── design.md       # Technical patterns\n├── changes/                # Proposals - what SHOULD change\n│   ├── [change-name]/\n│   │   ├── proposal.md     # Why, what, impact\n│   │   ├── tasks.md        # Implementation checklist\n│   │   ├── design.md       # Technical decisions (optional; see criteria)\n│   │   └── specs/          # Delta changes\n│   │       └── [capability]/\n│   │           └── spec.md # ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED\n│   └── archive/            # Completed changes\n```\n\n## Creating Change Proposals\n\n### Decision Tree\n\n```\nNew request?\n├─ Bug fix restoring spec behavior?

Implementation\n- [ ] 1.1 Create database schema\n- [ ] 1.2 Implement API endpoint\n- [ ] 1.3 Add frontend component\n- [ ] 1.4 Write tests\n```\n\n5. **Create design.md when needed:**\nCreate `design.md` if any of the following apply; otherwise omit it:\n- Cross-cutting change (multiple services/modules) or a new architectural pattern\n- New external dependency or significant data model changes\n- Security, performance, or migration complexity\n- Ambiguity that benefits from technical decisions before coding\n\nMinimal `design.md` skeleton:\n```markdown\n## Context\n[Background, constraints, stakeholders]\n\n## Goals / Non-Goals\n- Goals: [...]\n- Non-Goals: [...]\n\n## Decisions\n- Decision: [What and why]\n- Alternatives considered: [Options + rationale]\n\n## Risks / Trade-offs\n- [Risk] → Mitigation\n\n## Migration Plan\n[Steps, rollback]\n\n## Open Questions\n- [...]\n```\n\n## Spec File Format\n\n### Critical: Scenario Formatting\n\n**CORRECT** (use #### headers):\n```markdown\n#### Scenario: User login success\n- **WHEN** valid credentials provided\n- **THEN** return JWT token\n```\n\n**WRONG** (don't use bullets or bold):\n```markdown\n- **Scenario: User login**  ❌\n**Scenario**: User login     ❌\n### Scenario: User login      ❌\n```\n\nEvery requirement MUST have at least one scenario.\n\n### Requirement Wording\n- Use SHALL/MUST for normative requirements (avoid should/may unless intentionally non-normative)\n\n### Delta Operations\n\n- `## ADDED Requirements` - New capabilities\n- `## MODIFIED Requirements` - Changed behavior\n- `## REMOVED Requirements` - Deprecated features\n- `## RENAMED Requirements` - Name changes\n\nHeaders matched with `trim(header)` - whitespace ignored.\n\n#### When to use ADDED vs MODIFIED\n- ADDED: Introduces a new capability or sub-capability that can stand alone as a requirement. Prefer ADDED when the change is orthogonal (e.g., adding \"Slash Command Configuration\") rather than altering the semantics of an existing requirement.\n- MODIFIED: Changes the behavior, scope, or acceptance criteria of an existing requirement. Always paste the full, updated requirement content (header + all scenarios). The archiver will replace the entire requirement with what you provide here; partial deltas will drop previous details.\n- RENAMED: Use when only the name changes. If you also change behavior, use RENAMED (name) plus MODIFIED (content) referencing the new name.\n\nCommon pitfall: Using MODIFIED to add a new concern without including the previous text. This causes loss of detail at archive time. If you aren’t explicitly changing the existing requirement, add a new requirement under ADDED instead.\n\nAuthoring a MODIFIED requirement correctly:\n1) Locate the existing requirement in `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md`.\n2) Copy the entire requirement block (from `### Requirement: ...` through its scenarios).\n3) Paste it under `## MODIFIED Requirements` and edit to reflect the new behavior.\n4) Ensure the header text matches exactly (whitespace-insensitive) and keep at least one `#### Scenario:`.\n\nExample for RENAMED:\n```markdown\n## RENAMED Requirements\n- FROM: `### Requirement: Login`\n- TO: `### Requirement: User Authentication`\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Errors\n\n**\"Change must have at least one delta\"**\n- Check `changes/[name]/specs/` exists with .md files\n- Verify files have operation prefixes (## ADDED Requirements)\n\n**\"Requirement must have at least one scenario\"**\n- Check scenarios use `#### Scenario:` format (4 hashtags)\n- Don't use bullet points or bold for scenario headers\n\n**Silent scenario parsing failures**\n- Exact format required: `#### Scenario: Name`\n- Debug with: `openspec show [change] --json --deltas-only`\n\n### Validation Tips\n\n```bash\n# Always use strict mode for comprehensive checks\nopenspec validate [change] --strict\n\n# Debug delta parsing\nopenspec show [change] --json | jq '.deltas'\n\n# Check specific requirement\nopenspec show [spec] --json -r 1\n```\n\n## Happy Path Script\n\n```bash\n# 1) Explore current state\nopenspec spec list --long\nopenspec list\n# Optional full-text search:\n# rg -n \"Requirement:|Scenario:\" openspec/specs\n# rg -n \"^#|Requirement:\" openspec/changes\n\n# 2) Choose change id and scaffold\nCHANGE=add-two-factor-auth\nmkdir -p openspec/changes/$CHANGE/{specs/auth}\nprintf \"## Why\\n...\\n\\n## What Changes\\n- ...\\n\\n## Impact\\n- ...\\n\" > openspec/changes/$CHANGE/proposal.md\nprintf \"## 1.

Run `openspec list` to see active changes\n2. Check for overlapping specs\n3. Coordinate with change owners\n4. Consider combining proposals\n\n### Validation Failures\n1. Run with `--strict` flag\n2. Check JSON output for details\n3. Verify spec file format\n4. Ensure scenarios properly formatted\n\n### Missing Context\n1. Read project.md first\n2. Check related specs\n3. Review recent archives\n4. Ask for clarification\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n### Stage Indicators\n- `changes/` - Proposed, not yet built\n- `specs/` - Built and deployed\n- `archive/` - Completed changes\n\n### File Purposes\n- `proposal.md` - Why and what\n- `tasks.md` - Implementation steps\n- `design.md` - Technical decisions\n- `spec.md` - Requirements and behavior\n\n### CLI Essentials\n```bash\nopenspec list              # What's in progress?\nopenspec show [item]       # View details\nopenspec validate --strict # Is it correct?\nopenspec archive <change-id> [--yes|-y]  # Mark complete (add --yes for automation)\n```\n\nRemember: Specs are truth. Changes are proposals. Keep them in sync.\n"}}
