## Mockup-Specific Decisions

### Mockup 1: Empty App State

**Key Decisions Made:**
1. **Onboarding Approach**: Chose friendly, motivational empty state over tutorial overlay to reduce friction
2. **Primary CTA**: "Create Your First Position" directly launches core user flow
3. **Feature Highlighting**: Added 4 key benefits to build confidence before first use
4. **Visual Identity**: Used ðŸ“Š emoji as app icon placeholder (will be replaced with proper icon)
5. **Bottom Navigation**: Implemented immediately to establish information architecture

**Rationale:**
- Empty states should inspire action, not overwhelm with instructions
- Highlighting privacy-first approach addresses common trading app concerns
- Mobile-first design with fixed bottom nav follows native app conventions

### Mockup 2: Position Creation Flow

**Key Decisions Made:**
1. **Multi-Step Flow**: 4-step wizard (Setup â†’ Risk â†’ Journal â†’ Confirm) plus success state
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Break complex form into digestible chunks to reduce cognitive load
3. **Step Indicator**: Visual dots show progress and allow understanding of flow length
4. **Risk Calculator**: Real-time calculation of position metrics to aid decision-making
5. **Forced Journaling**: Step 3 dedicated entirely to documentation with multiple required fields
6. **Immutable Confirmation**: Final step requires explicit checkbox acknowledgment with warning styling
7. **Form Validation**: Strategic validation points prevent progression with incomplete data
8. **Success Animation**: Positive reinforcement after completion to build habit satisfaction

**Field Decisions:**
- **Trade Setup**: Symbol, strategy dropdown, entry/exit prices, quantity
- **Risk Assessment**: Auto-calculated metrics plus manual portfolio risk percentage
- **Journal Fields**: Trade thesis (required), market conditions, exit strategy
- **Confirmation**: Summary format with red warning styling for immutability

**Interaction Patterns:**
- Fixed bottom action bar with contextual button text
- Back button in header and bottom actions for flexible navigation
