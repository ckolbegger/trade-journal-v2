## üéØ **Next Priorities for Phase 1A Completion**

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. **Position Dashboard** - Display created positions with status 'planned'
2. **Journal Entry System** - Required thesis entries during position creation
3. **Trade Execution Flow** - Convert planned positions to open trades
4. **Daily Review System** - Price updates and P&L calculations

---

## 2. Add Mandatory Journal Entries to Position Creation üîÑ **NEXT**

**Description**: Add journal entry requirement to position creation and create journal history view.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- JournalEntry interface: id, position_id?, entry_type ('position_plan'|'position_update'|'position_close'|'market_observation'), content, timestamp, created_date
- IndexedDB for journal_entries: basic CRUD operations
- Add step 3 to position creation: Trading Journal (required thesis entry)
- Journal entries linked to positions via position_id
- Journal history view (06-journal-history-view.html) showing all entries chronologically
- Position creation now saves both position and initial journal entry
- Journal entries can exist without position_id for general market observations

## 3. Add Trade Execution Against Position Plans

**Description**: Enable actual trade execution against position plans, transitioning from 'planned' to 'open' status with real P&L calculation.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Trade interface: id, position_id, trade_type ('buy'|'sell'), quantity, price, execution_date, notes, timestamp
- IndexedDB for trades: basic CRUD operations
- Trade execution flow (02b-add-trade-flow.html) accessible from position detail
- Position status updates: 'planned' ‚Üí 'open' after first buy trade
- Cost basis calculation: simple average of buy trade prices
- Trade history display in position detail view
- Two-trade validation: maximum 1 buy, 1 sell per position
- Dashboard updates to show positions with actual trades vs just plans
- Position detail view shows actual trade data and average cost

## 4. Add Daily Review and Price Update System

**Description**: Enable systematic daily position review with price updates and P&L calculation. Foundation for habit-forming behavioral training.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Price history storage: {position_id: string, symbol: string, date: string, price: number, timestamp: string}[]
- Daily review interface: systematic position-by-position review workflow
- Manual price update functionality: date picker, price input, update button
- Real P&L calculation: (current_price - avg_cost) √ó actual_quantity for open positions
- Theoretical P&L for planned positions: (current_price - target_entry_price) √ó target_quantity
- Position detail view shows current P&L based on latest price update
- Dashboard cards display current P&L with color coding (green=profitable, red=losing)
- Review workflow guides users through each open position sequentially
- Price updates stored with timestamps for tracking review consistency

## 5. Add Journal Entry Creation During Daily Review

**Description**: Integrate journal entry opportunities into the daily review process to reinforce reflection habits.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

## 6. Add Position Closing Workflow

**Description**: Complete position lifecycle with structured closing process and final P&L.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Position closing flow (05-position-closing-flow.html) with 4 steps: Details ‚Üí Reason ‚Üí Reflection ‚Üí Confirmation
- Position status updates: 'open' ‚Üí 'closed' after sell trade
- Required closing journal entry (entry_type: 'position_close')
