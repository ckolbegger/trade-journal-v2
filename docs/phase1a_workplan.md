## **Slice 1: Trade Data Foundation** 📊

**Description**: Implement core trade entity and service layer to support single opening trade execution tracking with embedded trades in Position objects. Focus on foundation for single trades only (Phase 1A limitation).

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Position interface updated to include `trades: Trade[]` array (future-proof for multiple trades)
- TradeService created for single trade operations within positions
- Simple cost basis = first trade price (no FIFO complexity)
- Position status computed from trade data ('planned' | 'open' only)
- All existing position creation flow continues to work
- Database schema maintains backward compatibility

### **1.1 Trade Data Model Integration (TDD)**
**Write failing tests** for Trade interface and Position integration:
- **Unit tests**: Trade interface validation, Position.trades array handling
- **Unit tests**: Backward compatibility with existing positions (empty trades array)
- **Service tests**: PositionService handles embedded trades array correctly

**Implementation Tasks**:
```typescript
// Add to Position interface
interface Position {
  // ... existing fields
  trades: Trade[]  // New field for embedded trades (future-proof array)
}

interface Trade {
  id: string
  trade_type: 'buy' | 'sell'
  quantity: number
  price: number
  timestamp: Date
  notes?: string
}
```

- Update `src/lib/position.ts` with Trade interface and Position.trades field
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing positions (empty trades array)
- Update PositionService to handle embedded trades array
- **Phase 1A Planning Note**: Only one trade per position, but data structure supports multiple

### **1.2 TradeService Implementation (TDD)**
**Write failing tests** for single trade operations:
- **Unit tests**: addTrade() method for single opening trades
- **Unit tests**: Simple cost basis calculation (trades[0].price)
- **Validation tests**: Trade quantity, price, timestamp validation
- **Edge case tests**: Prevent adding multiple trades in Phase 1A context

**Implementation Tasks**:
- Create `src/services/TradeService.ts` for trade operations within positions
- Implement `addTrade()` method (no `removeTrade()` needed)
- Add simple cost basis calculation: `costBasis = trades[0]?.price ?? 0`
- Add trade validation (positive quantities, valid prices, reasonable timestamps)
- Ensure atomic updates to position.trades array via PositionService
- **No FIFO**: Defer complex cost basis calculations to Phase 2

### **1.3 Position Status Computation (TDD)**
**Write failing tests** for status calculation logic:
- **Unit tests**: `computePositionStatus()` function with direct inputs/outputs
  - Input: `trades.length === 0` → Output: `'planned'`
  - Input: `trades.length > 0` → Output: `'open'`
- **Service tests**: PositionService computes status dynamically
- **Integration tests**: Position status updates propagate to UI components

**Implementation Tasks**:
- Create `computePositionStatus()` utility function with simple logic
- Implement status logic: no trades = 'planned', has trades = 'open'
- **No 'closed' status**: Defer position closing to Phase 2
- Update PositionService to compute status dynamically from trades array
- Ensure status updates trigger appropriate UI refreshes

**Timeline**: 3-5 days (simplified scope)
**Expected Outcome**: Solid foundation for single trade tracking with future-proof data structures
