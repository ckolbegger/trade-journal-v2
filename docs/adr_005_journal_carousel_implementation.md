# ADR-005: Journal Entry Carousel Implementation

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The PositionDetail view currently displays journal entries in a vertical list format. A mockup has been provided showing a carousel implementation that enhances the user experience for reviewing journal entries.

## Decision
We will implement a carousel component that:
1. Maintains chronological sorting of journal entries internally
2. Initially displays the most recent (last) entry
3. Provides clear navigation controls with disabled states at boundaries
4. Supports both click and touch navigation
5. Integrates with existing accordion functionality

## Consequences

### Positive
- Improved UX for reviewing journal entries
- Better use of screen space on mobile devices
- More focused attention on individual journal entries
- Maintains backward compatibility with data flows
- Touch-friendly navigation for mobile users

### Neutral
- Requires additional component abstraction
- Adds slight complexity to navigation logic
- Minor performance overhead for slide transitions

### Negative
- None identified

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Simple CSS Grid/List**: 
   - ❌ Doesn't provide focused review experience
   - ❌ Doesn't match modern UI expectations
   - Status: Rejected

2. **Complex Third-party Component Library**:
   - ❌ Would add dependencies beyond scope
   - ❌ Could conflict with mobile-first requirements
   - Status: Rejected

3. **Simple Horizontal Scroll**:
   - ❌ Less intuitive navigation than carousel
   - ❌ No clear indication of current position
   - Status: Rejected

## Implementation Details

### Component Structure
```jsx
<JournalCarousel 
  journalEntries={sortedEntries}
  loading={loadingState}
  error={errorMessage}
/>
```

### State Management
- Pure functional component
- Hook-based state management
- No side effects within component
- Clear boundary checking for navigation

### Navigation Logic
- Left arrow: Show previous (older) entry
- Right arrow: Show next (newer) entry
- Dot indicators: Direct navigation to entries
- Touch gestures: Swipe to navigate entries

## Mockup Requirements Compliance

### Fulfilled Requirements
- [x] Carousel container with sliding entry cards
- [x] Navigation controls (arrows + dots)
- [x] Clear indication of current slide
- [x] Chronological display order maintenance
- [x] Default to most recent entry display

### Design Elements Implemented
- [x] Mobile-responsive layout
- [x] Touch gesture support
- [x] Accessible navigation controls
- [x] Consistent styling with application
- [x] Proper error/loading state handling

## Testing Approach

### Unit Tests
- Component rendering verification
- Navigation state transitions
- Boundary condition handling
- Error/loading state behavior

### Integration Tests
- Data flow with PositionDetail
- Accordion interaction support
- Realistic journal entry data
- Mobile touch event simulation

## Future Considerations

### Enhancement Opportunities
1. Keyboard navigation support
2. Animation customization props
3. Numerical slide counter display
4. Auto-scroll educational mode

### Scalability Concerns
None - component design is lightweight and preserves existing architecture patterns.
