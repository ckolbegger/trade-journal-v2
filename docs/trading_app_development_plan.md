### Critical Understanding: Mockups as Architectural North Star

**These mockups serve as the architectural vision for the entire product, NOT the Phase 1 implementation scope.** Their primary purpose is to:

1. **Guide Future-Proof Architecture**: Show how Phase 1 decisions must accommodate complex multi-leg strategies
2. **Inform Data Model Design**: Demonstrate why Position vs Trade separation is essential
3. **Direct Component Architecture**: Show how simple stock components must extend to options
4. **Validate UX Patterns**: Ensure consistent interaction patterns across all strategy types
5. **Prevent Dead Ends**: Visualize the complete system to avoid architectural constraints

### Key Architectural Clarifications from Mockup Development
- **Strategy-Adaptive Architecture**: UI components must flexibly support 1-4 leg strategies
- **Position vs Trade Separation**: Critical for both behavioral training and complex strategy support
- **Behavioral Consistency**: Immutable planning and forced journaling patterns scale across all strategies
- **Manual Price Update System**: Privacy-first approach works for both simple and complex positions
- **Attention-Based Prioritization**: Algorithm must work for mixed stock/options portfolios

### Phase 1 Implementation Approach
**Build the architectural foundation shown in mockups, expose only stock functionality:**
- Implement full Position/Trade data models (including unused options fields)
- Build flexible UI components that render based on strategy complexity
- Create strategy-aware calculation engines (initially only stock calculations)
- Establish behavioral training patterns that work for all future strategies
- Set up manual price update system supporting multi-instrument positions

### Documentation Created
- `/mockups/design-decisions.md` - Comprehensive design rationale and behavioral psychology principles
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` with mockup preservation rules and UI consistency standards
- `/docs/strategy-ui-patterns-guide.md` - Analysis of strategy-specific UI patterns from mockups

## Phase 1 Implementation Strategy: Architecture vs Exposure

### The Future-Proofing Approach
**Build comprehensive architecture, expose simple functionality.** Phase 1 creates the foundation that enables all future phases without requiring rewrites or migrations.

**What This Means in Practice:**

**Data Models**: Implement complete Position and Trade entities from ADR-001, including all options fields
- Expose: Basic stock position fields in UI
- Include: option_type, strike_price, expiration_date fields in database (unused)
- Benefit: Phase 3+ can activate options without data migration

**UI Components**: Build strategy-adaptive components guided by mockups 04a-04d
- Expose: Simple stock position rendering (`strategy_type: 'stock'`)
- Include: Multi-leg display logic, conditional rendering based on strategy complexity
- Benefit: Adding covered calls just requires changing strategy type and exposing existing UI

**Calculation Engines**: Implement strategy-aware P&L and risk calculations
- Expose: Stock P&L calculations only (`(current_price - avg_cost) * quantity`)
- Include: Options pricing framework, multi-leg calculation scaffolding
- Benefit: Complex strategy calculations slot into existing engine

**Manual Price System**: Build multi-instrument price update architecture
- Expose: Single stock price input
- Include: Multi-instrument pricing models, spread calculations
- Benefit: Bull put spread pricing just activates existing framework

### Phase Relationship to Mockups

**Phase 1A Target**: 04-position-detail-view.html (simple stock)
- Full mockup functionality implemented
- Architecture supports 04a-04d mockups (not exposed)
- Users see simple, focused stock trading interface

**Phase 3 Target**: 04a-covered-call-detail-view.html  
- Activate covered call UI components (already built)
- Enable dual pricing model (stock + option)
- Turn on options fields in forms

**Phase 4-5 Targets**: 04b-04d mockups
- Multi-leg display components activate
- Complex calculation engines surface
- Advanced pricing models become available

### Success Criteria for Phase 1
